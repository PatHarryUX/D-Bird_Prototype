Issues:
1. NUMBER ONE: Form data is not submitted from mobile browsers. (This, presumably has something to do with how mobile browsers handle the jQuery AJAX method. Need to consult a javascript engineer to figure this one out)
2. Radio Button styling is broken in firefox browser.
3. Validation is broken. (For example, try submitting the form with a required field missing. -- I’m not sure how to get it to work right.)
4. “Thank You” does not have the CardoDB map with submission results. (This is because I don’t understand how to use iframes.)
5. Hero Image, Hero Content &Instructions all need to be fixed.
6. Placement of the “fold” for both desktop and mobile need to be fine-tuned/fixed.
7. Site does not have a footer. (Can be fixed easily. Let’s discuss this.)
8. UX issues with mobile location selection.
9. mapZoom is annoying for users who are using a scroll wheels or pad.
10. Date & Time fields pull up the mobile keyboard. Should only have date/time picker.
11. Mobile view does not include a map option in the “Select Location” fieldset.
12. Doesn’t have a Photo Upload (The solution to this problem is the use of a backend framework, such as Ruby on Rails.)
13. We only have one version of the site here. In order to improve the UX, we would ideally have at least two options, for A-B testing of functionality & UI.
